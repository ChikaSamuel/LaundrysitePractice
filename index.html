        <h1>Five Reasons Why You Should Dry Clean Your Clothes</h1>
            You buy a new pair of pants, and when you get home, you notice the tag says “Dry Clean Only.” 
            You may wonder what that means. Is it ever okay to wash “Dry Clean Only” pants in your washing machine at home?
            Unfortunately, the answer is no. <br>
            Will you hurt your new purchase if you skip professional dry cleaning? Maybe. <br>
            Is dry cleaning better than washing? In many cases, yes!
        <br>
            There are many benefits of using professional dry cleaning services on certain types of garments.
            Here are the top five advantages of dry cleaning.

         <h1> 1. Dry Cleaning Preserves Delicate Fabrics </h1>
        
            You may notice that delicate fabrics fall apart or lose their shape when you put them in your washing machine. 
            Even the gentlest cycle can impact these pieces. Dry cleaning won’t have the same effect since it doesn’t 
            use soap that can alter the fabric and doesn’t include a spin cycle that can stretch or fade clothes.
        <br>
        <br>
            Anything that might lose its shape or needs gentle care should be dry cleaned, such as:
        <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Neckties</li>
                <li>Blazers</li>
                <li>Pleated clothing</li>
                <li>Fabrics such as cashmere and acrylic</li>
            </ol>

        <h1> 2. Dry Cleaners Can Remove Tough Stains </h1>
        
            If you have ever spilled tomato sauce or red wine on a blouse, 
            you know how difficult it is to remove the stain. Even so, you don’t have to throw the piece out.
            Taking it to the dry cleaner as soon as possible, before the stain sets, offers the best chance at stain removal.
            Refrain from using any stain removers on dry clean only garments, 
            as they can often set stains and make them harder to remove. 
            Dry cleaning dissolves oils and grease to leave clothing looking pristine.

        <h1> 3. Dry Cleaning Improves the Longevity of Your Clothing </h1>
        
            Clothing washed in a washing machine breaks down over time. The spin cycle is tough on fabrics, 
            and fibers can wear down after just a few cleanings. Dry cleaning, on the other hand, is gentle on your clothing.
            We clean and press your clothing so it stays in its original shape and lasts longer.

         <h1> 4. Dry Cleaners Have Professional Knowledge </h1>
        
            An item with a “Dry Clean Only” tag indicates that it requires special care. 
            You likely don’t have the experience or the know-how to care for special pieces of clothing yourself. 
            Dry cleaners understand the science of clothing care, and they can determine the best course of action
            for clothing that needs special attention.

         <h1> 5. Dry Cleaning Saves You Time </h1>
        
            “Dry Clean Only” tags aren’t the only reason to take your clothes to the dry cleaner. 
            Washing items by hand is time-consuming. You could easily spend an entire day trying to 
            freshen up the blouses and sweaters in your closet. Taking them to the dry cleaner instead frees up your day.
            You can get more done and enjoy clean clothing to boot.
